# Abstract

This project will be built with the purpose of making life easi-er for sysadmins who wish to manage virtual machines re-motely, via an easy to use inter-face that even beginners would find simple to use. It will manage VirtualBox cli-ents, VMware clients and Linux KVM clients under the same UI and enable sysadmins to create, edit, and remotely view virtual machines via VNC. This Web UI would be installed on a hypervisor server within a building and be accessible from any location that has internet access.
