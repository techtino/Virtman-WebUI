# Abstract

This project will be built with the purpose of making life easier for sysadmins who wish to manage virtual machines remotely, via an easy to use interface that even beginners would find simple to use. It will manage VirtualBox clients, VMware clients and Linux KVM clients under the same UI and enable sysadmins to create, edit, remove and remotely view virtual machines via various technologies such as the Libvirt API and VNC. This Web UI would be installed on a hypervisor server within a building and be accessible from any location that has internet access. Additionally, LXC containers creation will be automated as well as implementing basic docker support.
